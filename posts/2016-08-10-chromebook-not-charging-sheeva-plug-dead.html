<p>A few days ago I had a sad week for my ARM devices, although it was nothing specific to ARM.</p>
<p>First, my HP Chromebook 11 played dead, refusing to start and refusing to charge. I was already preparing for some surgery as there were some hints on the intertubes that is a a known problem and it can be soved by unplugging the battery. Well, it showed once more that time is the best cure. After about 7-10 days the Chromebooked happily accepted the charger again.</p>
<p>The other case seems to me more fatal. My trusty Sheeva Plug (yes, one of those Marvell Kirkwood thingies) was, erm, “unresponsive” to any form of connection attempt, including UART. This time I attempted an autopsy and got my suspections confirmed: At least one of the caps in the PSU seemed to have blown. Current plans are to replace the internal PSU with the socket of a 2.1mm DC plug and using an external COTS-PSU as with other boards.<br />
I also had a look around for a replacement system, and the closest candidate is an ODROID-C2. Once this is supported by the Debian Netinstaller, I might upgrade. (I am aware of Armbian and other projects, but I prefer running a netinstall over slapping some pre-made image on my personal server.)</p>
