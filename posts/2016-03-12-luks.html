<p>Do you encrypt your disks/thumbdrives with <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md">LUKS</a>? Here’s three things to remember for setting up new volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn of power management.</li>
<li>Prefer a faster over a harder hash function (but always use a secure one).</li>
<li>Think twice on what you put inside.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few more, but the above three were the points that – for me – stood out most when I had a quick glance at <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/274">this nice paper</a> by Simone Bossi and Andrea Visconti.</p>
<p>They pick on a few issues with key-derivation in LUKS. Basically, LUKS tries to find a sweet spot between security and usability when parameters are selected in the setup process for a new LUKS-encrypted volume. That means the number of Hashing-Rounds for Key-Derivation is derived from the current performance of your machine. (LUKS, from v.1.7.0 on, aims for 2 seconds of runtime for key-derivation.) So when your computer (especially your laptop) is in power saving mode and/or under heavy load, you get a lot less rounds than in full power mode. Also, because harder hash functions tend to be slower, the number of rounds may also be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Third, if a known plaintext is available (the paper uses an ext-fs header as example), one gets a cheap key-distinguisher compared to the built-in hash-distinguisher, speeding up a brute-force attempt by about 25%.</p>

<p>Depends. If you are fighting the NSA, probably. If you are hiding the list of already ordered christmas presents (only 287 days left!) from you spouse, you’re still fine.</p>
<h3 id="bootnote">Bootnote</h3>
<p>There’s <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/273">another paper by the same authors</a> showing that a brute force-attack can be made even faster by exploiting some properties of PBKDF2.</p>
