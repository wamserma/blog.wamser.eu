<p>So <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/freewrite/">everyone</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2930075/Ditch-distractions-Hemingwrite-smart-typewriter-stops-surfing-web-lets-save-files-cloud.html">is going</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/02/24/freewrite-word-processor/">bananas</a> <a href="http://www.lesen.net/ebook-news/freewrite-e-ink-schreibmaschine-fuer-ablenkungsfreies-schreiben-25230/">about</a> the <a href="http://getfreewrite.com/">Freewrite</a> these day.</p>
<p>But is the hype justified? Personally, I’d say no. One of the first thoughts I had after I saw the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adamleeb/hemingwrite-a-distraction-free-digital-typewriter">Kickstarter Campaign</a> for the then named <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/08/60-seconds-with-hemingwrite-an-e-ink-typewriter/">Hemingwrite</a> was “this is just a clunky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaSmart#Dana">Alphasmart Dana</a>”. And the use case is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>So let’s have a quick check how far tech improved in the last 14 years.</p>
<p>The Freewrite has a ePaper-Display, which greatly benefits battery life. But in terms of screen real-estate the Freewrite does not push as far as it should. For proper writing it should have a bigger display, so you can comfortably have some context on the screen with a font of decent size. With a focus on writing prose I’d suggest an octavo-like format (<a href="http://www.pervasivedisplays.com/products/102">like this</a>).</p>
<p>With the eyes of someone writing scientific papers and blog posts like this, I’m missing Pandoc support (preferably in a WYSIWYG style). LaTeX would be over the top, but with a somewhat accessible *nix under the hood LaTeX rendering could easily be delegated to a server (think of a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex">ShareLaTeX</a> client).</p>
<p>It also seems hard to avoid the cloud. FTP/WebDAV access to own ressources would be nice, also for having access to ressources you need to have at hand for writing.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just not in the focus group.</p>
